1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,470
so in this section we're going to create
the Friends app which is a basic

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,630
contacts application that actually
stores data in the database now the

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,130
friends app will allow contact details
to be added edited and that will also

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:24,450
provide a way to search for individual
contacts in the database and although

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,840
this is fairly simple app this section
will introduce you to quite a few

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,190
important concepts and also methods as
well we're really trying to sort of ramp

7
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,540
up your speed and experience going to
start off with a discussion of databases

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,960
and we'll have a look at the databases
that are included with android

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,360
specifically SQLITE now when
using databases in an app

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,610
there are several different approaches
that can actually be used and generally

11
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:57,190
you have to assume that database access
will be quite slow so android provides

12
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,440
loader classes that can be used to
prevent your app from appearing to be

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,290
or appearing to hang while data is fetched
from the database and in addition to

14
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,070
this i'm also going to talk about cursors
and will actually use cursors in the

15
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,070
Friends app we've seen adapters we've use
those with the list view and recycler view

16
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,460
where they got their data from an
arraylist so in this section we'll also

17
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,140
see how to provide data to an adapter
but in this case the data is going to be

18
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,140
coming from a database and we'll also
see how all of this will fit into the picture to

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,320
prevent blocking the UI thread while
retrieving data from a database and this

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,250
is also good app to introduce the use of
fragments which are a good way to create

21
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,890
more versatile user interfaces and they also allow us to make better use of the

22
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,450
bigger screen on a tablet for example
while still providing the full features

23
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,800
on a smaller phone screen so a lot to
cover in this section let's make a start
